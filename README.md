# hangman

This is code for a game of hangman.
The code uses tkinter in order for players to see a graphical interface.

There are three difficulties: easy, medium, and hard.
Additionally, there are three play modes: single player, multiplayer, and Wheel of Fortune.
The difficulties only apply to single player mode.

Some repetition in the code is necessary when creating the different game modes due to slight alterations in the game rules and buttons. If there is a better way to do this, please let me know.
